# Data-cleaning
I will solve two problems for the fourth Math 200 assignment.

In the first problem, I will analyze a data set, attempt to define a "succesful" curveball, and then count the number of succesful curveballs.

In the second problem, I will analyze census data.  As part of this analysis, I will seperate one variable into two, then create a scatterplot.
